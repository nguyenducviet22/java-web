		Watching movies is an exciting way to spend one’s time, but for many
		of us, it doesn’t end there. Movie characters and their actions can
		inspire us, make us think about important things, and even reconsider
		our life choices. Strong, wise, and kind characters that can serve as
		role models are one of the reasons why we re-watch our favorite movies
		again and again.

		Movie lovers went to Ranker to vote for the female characters that
		inspire them the most, and here are the heroines who made it to the
		top 30. The winner surprised us, to be honest. What about you?
